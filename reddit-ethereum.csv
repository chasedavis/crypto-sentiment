## Welcome!

---

With the magical influx of new readers, I would like to warmly welcome everyone to r/ethereum. Please protect this community's philosophy by respecting our rules (see sidebar or scroll down). Let me quote the most important ones here for reference:

- Keep price discussion and market talk to subreddits such as /r/ethtrader.
- Keep mining discussion to subreddits such as /r/ethermining.
- Keep plain ICO advertisements to subreddits such as r/ethinvestor.

Feel free to use this thread to say 'Hi, I'm new!' or 'Hi, I'm _not_!'. If you have a question, feel free to comment and ask it below. But first **make sure you are fully synchronized** and **have a look at FAQ** on [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/q/431). Do you have any question that feels really dumb? Try r/ethereumnoobies :D

Don't forget to check out /r/ethdev for the Ethereum developer community and post your diamond-shaped cat findings r/ethsightings (don't forget to subscribe!). Thanks for flying with r/ethereum! :-)

## Getting Started

### What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a cutting-edge blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a crypto-fuel called _Ether_.

## Rules

---

Below are the rules that Reddit users on /r/Ethereum must follow to participate. These can be used as reasons to remove posts/comments and ban users.

### Golden Rule

You are expected to treat everyone with a certain level of respect and refrain from inappropriate behavior. Examples of inappropriate behavior include:

- Personal insults
- Threats of violence or attempts to organize attacks
- Slurs of any kind
- Posting people’s private information

If you can't play nice with others, you will not be allowed to post here.

### Ether Price, Market and Mining discussions

Discussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. In addition, keep mining discussion to Subreddits such as /r/EtherMining.

### Duplicate threads

Duplicate threads may be deleted. It is up to the discretion of the mods.

### No spamming or drive by posting

Spamming will lead to post deletion and a possible ban. Posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted right away - no _drive by posting_.

### Using multiple accounts

Creating multiple accounts to get around Reddit or Subreddit rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban.

### Misleading titles

Posts with purposely misleading or unsubstantiated titles will be removed.

### Karma &amp; age requirements for posting submissions

All post submissions should be made from accounts at least 10 days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. Exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis, message the mods for more information.

---

## Moderation philosophy

---

/r/Ethereum is a place for the open discussion about the Ethereum software, protocol, distributed applications, and related technologies. As moderators, we are here to make sure the discussion stays civil and productive. We will not censor posts based on personal ideology and welcome constructive discourse.

### What we ask of our users

- Please utilize the up-vote and down-vote buttons. This is a built in moderation tool that is very powerful.
- If you submit a report about a post or comment, please provide as much detail as possible to help us more quickly sort through our reported posts/comments.
- Please don’t report posts or comments you disagree with, only about things that actually break the rules.
- We welcome discussions about other crypto-currencies and Ethereum implementations, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads we kindly ask you to consider posting it to a more specific Subreddit. You can check an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the [""All Ethereum"" Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum).

CryptoKitties combines very basic functionality of the Ethereum network (transactions that interact with complex contracts) into a game that's unusually fun to play. To create the market dynamic we're seeing, the game incorporates a few clever features that work together: a marketplace, trait scarcity, randomness, a lineage decay model, a minimum cost for a new lineage, cool-down, and of course, ""awww-inspiring"" kittens.

The exciting aspect of this game, though, is that all of the actual game mechanics are done completely without the use of a central server. You could extrapolate this idea a bit further and imagine:

* CryptoKitties, instead of hosting assets on Google Cloud Storage, stores all assets on decentralized networks like Swarm or IPFS.
* Continue the trend and imagine that CryptoKitties.co was instead CryptoKitties.eth, and that ENS domain pointed to a contract that could be rendered in a browser like [Moon](https://github.com/ethereum/moon-browser) (announced at Devcon3).
* It's likely that even the future 2-7.5 second block time enabled by the Casper PoS consensus mechanism won't be fast enough for prime-time. Slap a Raiden channel on that bitch for low-latency transactions.
* Are CryptoKitties transactions clogging the entire network with random adoption/cat-mating transactions? Put it all on a [Plasma](https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf) subchain contract. (I'm unfamiliar with hypothetical block times on a single-level Plasma PoS subchain, so Raiden might be necessary for low-latency transactions on Plasma.)

The implications of building dapps like this on platforms as capable as Ethereum are huge. The cost of data storage, infrastructure, and deployment is next to nothing, and this makes the only real barrier to launching a killer app putting it into code.

Yes, CryptoKitties is a very basic example of a decentralized game, and yes, it's clogging the entire network right now, but it's got me pretty excited about the future of dapps. [Spacewar!](http://spacewar.oversigma.com/) is considered to be one of the first real computer games to be developed, and could be an interesting analog.

My wife is a big fan of digital art trading platforms like Alacrity and Chicken Smoothie, so I figured she would love CryptoKitties.

Long story short the ether I sent her to play with got stuck after MetaMask set a bad gas price with all the current congestion and her shiny new Ether got stuck.  I got it unstuck, so let's go from there!

Let's un-stick yours!  What we are going to do is effectively cancel out the transaction that is holding up your account.  You may have to do this multiple times if you have multiple stuck transactions with too low of a Gas Price set.  Unfortunately, you will lose the fee, but your account will be unstuck, which doesn't sound too bad.

First, let's go to www.myetherwallet.com

Then you want to go to tab that says Check TX Status

Let's go ahead and grab your TX Hash, which should look like this  on Etherscan:

    TX Hash	0x22b3e759f8fac50f2d7a871525f55c411a21b3b42296200000000000000

You can find this on the left most column of your account, and you want to make sure it's the first stuck transaction on your account.  When you look at the transaction, it should say ""Nonce: 1"".

Let's put that TX Hash into the Check TX Status and check it!

Whoa, it's pending (we knew this).  Let's go ahead and cancel this transaction.

What we are going to do is effectively ""update"" this transaction to cancel it out.

Go ahead and make the ""To Address"" yourself,  then structure the rest like this.

    Amount to Send
        0
    Gas Limit
        21000
    Data
        This data won't be editable, you don't need to anyways, skip it.
    Nonce
        1 (Very important you make sure it's the same Nonce as the stuck transaction, this may differ depending on how many transactions you have done that haven't gone through.)
    Gas Price
        You want to make this 10% higher than what you originally used.  If the transaction continues to be stuck for a while, increase this again and submit again.  I used 30 Gwei, you can probably get away with less if you're more patient.

After you have done this, choose a method to unlock your account, and then click on ""Generate Transaction"".

After double checking it, send the transaction.

Give it a few minutes and if the Gas was high enough, you will see a ""Self"" transaction on your account that will cancel out that stuck transaction!

Congratulations, your account should operate properly now unless you have more pending TXs with too low of a Gas Price.

I would be very interested in seeing some people trying to implement something akin to hashgraph (or IOTA) as a state-channel consensus algorithm with on-chain settlement. 

The idea would be to have users join a state-channel with funds X, run a consensus node implementing the Hashgraph (or PoW, IOTA style consensus rules) consensus protocol. Users would then exchanges messages with one another (or verify 2 transactions before sending a transaction like IOTA) and follow rules akin to the ones described in the [Hashgraph whitepaper](http://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf) (or IOTA's). 

What would be the benefits? Well, obviously the hashgraph is awesome for small groups that want to interact really quickly and IOTA seems great for free and reliable transfer of funds, but they can't really interact (yet) with other distributed technologies out there like Ethereum. If implemented as state-channels on Ethereum, users could move in and out of these state channels as they please very easily and interact with the rest of the awesome Ethereum ecosystem.

&gt; The report was received from MyEtherWallet support staff.

&gt; In order to re-enable your account you must [click here](https://reviewnic.com/redirect.php?url=http://glassjumbo.co.uk) and verify the suspicious transaction.  
&gt; Once you do this, I will start the process to have your account redacted from that list.

&gt; Do not file a new ticket as that will slow the process and will not change the process.  You are in my queue and will not have to wait so long for a response.  Thank you for your patience and sorry for the inconvenience.
&gt;We cannot close an account that was reported for suspicious activity nor can we return the funds to you without knowing for sure you are who you claim to be.
&gt; Should you continue to refuse to verify, this ticket will be solved and the information will be forwarded to our legal counsel, where it will remain until you or your legal representative contacts them at which point the legal process will kick in.

For example, VECHAIN is involved in the supply chain business and issues their own ECR-20 currency, VEN.  VECHAIN says that you have to buy VEN in order to use their service, and has issued a fixed supply of VEN.

I take this to mean that a consumer cannot purchase from VECHAIN and give them USD in exchange for goods/services; instead, the consumer must go to an exchange, purchase VEN, and then exchange the VEN for goods/services from VECHAIN.

If this is correct, does that mean that purchasing services from VECHAIN could vary wildly on a day-to-day, since 1 VEN could be worth $0.50 USD today and $2.00 tomorrow?  

Or is the model that ""VECHAIN's goods and services cost $50 USD, and you must give us the VEN equivalent of $50 USD to purchase""?

If it is the first method, then how could the company operate with any stability when the price for their goods/services could wildly fluctuate?  Couldn't a competitor just buy as many VEN tokens as possible, thus artificially raising the price and steering potential customers away (and/or sell off large quantities to create instability for the company)?

If it is the latter, then what is the advantage to even issuing the tokens in the first place?  Wouldn't it just make more sense for VECHAIN to accept USD and then control the entire supply of VEN and all nodes (on different servers in different locations), thus keeping the immutable ledger benefit of a blockchain while ensuring price stability?

But they are clogging the network either through poor design or as a marketing gimmick. The network disruption is causing some to think that massive numbers of transactions are happening(they are) and that their is a rush on fake cats(not really)

Rough math for marketing guys and gals out there: Assuming a max of ~10tx per sec (that's high)  we are limited to  315 million tx per year. or 886k per day =  37k per hour = 615 per minute, So if you want to be an asshole. set up a bot that will call a low value function on your tx, set gas to minimum and lock the network. Everyone will see your contract is doing ""such big numbers!"" and you are a rockstar 

The [kittycore contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d)  lists a [CEO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2041bb7d8b49f0bde3aa1fa7fb506ac6c539394c), [CFO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf1e54b359b0897133f437fc961dd16f20c045e1), and [COO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa21037849678af57f9865c6b9887f4e339f6377a) account for admin reasons(which is cool and more contracts should do this) 

The problem is that some people are too into breeding cats. I stare at tx pools all day, I notice these kinds of things. Low cost operations that are called at high frequency. For example, account [0xa21](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa21037849678af57f9865c6b9887f4e339f6377a) has called either autobreed or give birth 23k times in the last 20 hours.

I’m focusing my next two weeks of discovery on all projects in the government realm. Specifically, anything that relates to self sovereignty. Thought I would ask you guys if you had seen any interesting projects related to this? Or papers on this subject? Or anything broadly related to it?

I saw that Vitalik had posted a poll on Twitter last week with Government as one option which was one of the highest scoring.

I read a book ‘The Soverign Individual’ by James Dale Davidson and since learning about blockchain &amp; identity projects like uPort I have not been able to stop thinking about how empowered we as individuals could become from the realisation of such a project, despite the massive hurdles which exist.

Alice wants to sell a house, Bob wants to buy a house. A smart contract is created to serve this trade.

So I’ll start telling how I understand this contract and the flaws that I couldn’t  understand. 
1. Bob sends money, Alice sends ownership token to the contract through functions like sendToken(), sendMoney(). 
2. The contract wait until both send their properties for trade, then the contract will trigger the functions trade(), giving Bob the ownership token and Alice money.
3. The contract ended.

Here are my questions:
1. How a real world property ownership can be injected to the function sendToken()? If the answer is the trusted oracle then this oracle can team up with Alice and scam Bob (even the chance is rare tho)
2. What to prove that Bob own the new house when all he got is a digital token? Does government protect this kind of ownership now, or soon?

The advantages of Dapp I can see are:
1. The money can’t vanish due to bankruptcy, escrow scam, disaster, hacker (maybe but real hard).
2. Saving money, time for paperwork involved.

Ontology conceptually describes a reputation system component. But it's not the focus of the project, is not even started and it's on the NEO blockchain.

I believe that building a reputation system will be difficult because it needs to reach critical mass in order to truly be useful. But I see it as one of the most promising use cases. I see it as something which might start with identity management, slowly evolving into a mechanism to place a score on a standardized sets of skills or topics. As the system grows, users would have economic incentives to truthfully vouch for others based on the capacity of their relationship. The network effect would make the reputation scores increasingly accurate, similarly to how PageRank uses backlinks to accurately rank websites.

First, let me address those of you that think this is a scam.  I get it.  I’d be skeptical too.

https://imgur.com/3jhXQQt

This image I took today, Sunday 12/3/2017 and it shows me and my daughter, the wallet address that was compromised, a picture of me with my miners from 2016 and a reference to a previous Reddit post that you can view.  I had a random deposit from Ethermine the other day so I have 0.35 ether left which I will make a transfer of a small amount today to prove that it is my account.  Any other skeptics, I am happy to address questions and do anything I can to prove that my story is legit.

What I am hoping to get out of sharing this story:

First, I want to prevent others from making the same mistake.

Second, I want to connect with the community in hopes that there is something that can be done to recover my coins.  Yes, I know this is almost impossible but with this amount of money I have to try.

At the very least, I would appreciate if you could help get my story out there.  My crypto community is my only saving grace.  Share my story if you would be so kind.

I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t accept donations.  At the same time I want to be clear that donations are not what I am expecting from this post.  I’m not asking that you believe me but please do not be disrespectful with your comments.  I worked very hard to mine these coins and I already feel embarrassed and completely devastated.  I acknowledge that I made some mistakes but I was doing everything within my power and within my knowledge at the time to protect myself.  If I was the type of woman expecting to rely on others to get my by, cryptocurrency mining would be the last route I would take.  I'm a hardworking person that made a mistake.

What I am not looking for:

I’ve posted on other subreddits and I am aware of all of the possible ways I could have been hacked.  Rehashing that now is not going to change the outcome.  If you have solid advice or know anyone that might be able to help, that is what I am looking for.  I’m not looking for help finding out what happened, how I was hacked, etc. unless you feel that it will help get my money back.  I have the Ledger Blue and I was already taking appropriate steps to secure my funds, this obviously didn’t happen soon enough as there was a delay in it shipping to me.  

Also, I acknowledge that I had a password protected excel spreadsheet on my computer which, in hindsight, was my biggest mistake.  What’s done is done.  I take full responsibility there.

My story:

I'm a single mom, a nurse, and trying to make it on my own.  I had almost no tech experience but took it upon myself to researched crypto years ago. I took a chance and built a mining operation in my garage. Months of blood, sweat, tears, sleepless nights and doubt finally payed off. I couldn’t believe I did it. Built computers, controlled the heat and they were up and running.  
As the coins came in my dreams for financial security were finally a reality. College for my daughter, paying off my car, my college loan all the things that seemed so out of reach were happening there in my garage.

And in a moment it was all gone. I do not know how this happened and I've come up with a variety of scenarios. I did not share my information, I double checked urls before entering info, never opened suspicious emails, etc. I pulled all my ether off of any exchanges I had it on what I thought I was safe using MyEtherWallet. I ordered the ledger blue, which was in production at the time (Aug 2017), and I received it a couple of weeks ago (Nov 2017). When I went to transfer the coins onto the ledger wallet I was horrified to find all of my ether are gone! I'm devastated!

The strange thing about the situation is that the coins are still sitting on the address they were sent to. It appears to be a wallet and not an exchange address. They have not moved. I am confident I did not create this address because, had I done so, I would have definitely sent a test transaction and would never have moved that much money on one transaction.  I will place a watch on this address and hope that it someday moves to an exchange.  

I shut down the mining operation about a year ago and I have no way to recover my losses. My dreams of being financially secure and providing for my daughter have been ripped out from under me.

Please if anyone can help me or knows anyone that could help me I will forever be grateful.

Other facts:
•	I did have some Ether Classic on that same wallet that were untouched. I have since moved it to the ledger wallet.
•	Tokens on the wallet were also unmoved.
•	No I did not click on any emails to access MEW. 
•	I never, in any form, shared my private keys with anyone.

You can verify the transaction here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa74fb87831b2d3182df8716ede01fdb0ea6a57fb

Thank you for your support. I hope to hear from someone that might be able to help. I know only a miracle could save it now.

Validators should be able to defend against 51% attacks so, for instance if the person who owns the most Ethereum split his Ethereum into multiple wallets and creates a validator node, he shouldn't be able to execute a 51% attacks. So the number of Ethereum one must have in this case should be : ""Amount of Eth the most Eth owner in the world has"" / ( number of validators x 51%)

**My Understanding of the Blockchain:**

* Ethereum currently runs on a proof-of-work style blockchain, there is a plan to move Ethereum to a proof-of-stake style blockchain in there future

**What I'd Like to Learn About the Blockchain:**

* When is this change scheduled to take place, what are the pros and cons of switching to this system

**My Understanding of the Mining Process:** 

* The average time for a block to be solved is around 14 seconds (we are seeing around 6100 blocks mined per day)

* 3 Ethereum is the reward for each block mined (under the current system)

**What I'd Like to Learn About the Mining Process:** 

* Although there is currently no determined hard cap on Ethereum like there is on Bitcoin, is there any schedule along the lines of halving rewards

**My Understanding of Ethereum as a Currency:**

* Each Ether is divisible into 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei, making it great for microtransactions

* Ethereum possesses a transparent Blockchain 

* Ethereum is transferable at incredibly high speeds **(I believe they are tied to how long it takes for blocks to be mined as thats what updates the blockchain, please correct me if wrong)**, making them transferable in around a 14s time frame

* Similar to other Blockchain tech, this should eliminate the middle man/intermediary

**What I'd Like to Learn About Ethereum as a Currency:**

* How much anonymity comes with transactions? Is this something that could earn a bad rep due to the dark market, or is that a market that is favoring Monero

* What timeline could we be looking at for Ethereum to become a more mainstream form of payment (I'd assume we're looking at years as the unit of measurement) 

* Is the currency itself only programmable via smart contracts (could I program the currency itself so it can only be used to buy goods from 'Store X' and if it hasn't been by 'Time Y' I can have them returned to me)

**My Understanding of Smart Contracts (not too strong):**

* Ownership of things like cars and houses can be uploaded into these smart contracts (can eliminate the need to verify these things with outside parties for $$$ fees)

* They are first paid for and then set to yield a result when a certain set of events has been completed/clauses have been met

* They can feature expiration dates

* Make transferring portions of what you own easy (I can sell my 1/3rd stake in something, or go in with 10 people to buy a house)

**What I'd Like to Learn About Smart Contracts:**

* Can this type of tech be implemented towards things like mortgages, leases (I'd assume so)

* Even though its in Java (pretty big upside), won't there be somewhat of a middleman due to the fact that a large portion of the population won't be able to code these conditions

* What are smart contracts tied to, is it limited to one smart contract per block mined, how are these attained and is there any scarcity to this

**My Understanding of DAPPS:**

* These start ups come to the market in the form of ICOs

* A lot of these start ups possess no value proposition (obviously some still do), but this kind of strikes me as something that could resemble a dotcom bubble and bust if they ever explode into the mainstream

* This appears to be one of the big drivers of Ethereum's future upside

**What I'd Like to Learn About DAPPs:** 

* Is there anywhere I can find a downloadable list of ICO history/activity (other than Coindesk)

* How tightly correlated is the future growth of Ethereum and the state of DAPPs and their ICOs

* How threatened is the ICO market to certain countries beginning to pay attention and consider regulating it

* What time frame do you guys see for these hitting mainstream

**Miscellaneous Questions:**

* Is gas referring to the transaction costs of Ethereum

* Any big news on the horizon (spent lots of time trying to learn, haven't been to up to date with any major changes)

* Do you guys think Ethereum at its current state is predominantly from it trading as a speculative commodity (with the future upside being as it stabilizes in value, establishes itself as a currency, and the DAPPs market expands) or do you think there are more underlying drivers

I appreciate if you made it this far. I don't expect anyone to have definitive answers to all these questions, but these are things I would love to read up on and have a discussion on.

I hope to join you guys in the future (hopefully sometime soon) as an investor in both Ether and the DAPPs it spawns",None,PierreMcGuiresHair,t3_7gvwdt

Yesterday was a very big day for me.

I finally had the courage to take the big step and resign from a fulltime dayjob as a banker in order to focus one hundred percent on crypto!

Since having met crypto in 2013 it has kept growing on me. Now the force of decentralization just has become too heavy and I had to give in. This decision ultimately feels very natural and I am very motivated to contribute where ever possible in the Ethereum ecosystem.
I hope some of the people reading this could forward me any projects looking for someone like me (people wanting to help manage a slackroom / Discord / Twitter / Telegram of a project / …).

I’m not a programmer, but I’m very good with people and I know my way around crypto (exchanges / decentralized exchanges / community management and have a general good understanding of how everything works).

Lately I’ve been giving crypto-consultancy to a VC firm aswell. I read a lot on different projects, follow a lot of the better quality crypto personalities and watch the conferences whenever uploaded. I speak fluently in English, Dutch, French and a bit of German.

So yea, drop me a DM 😊

If your reply results in me regaining access to my wallet, I'll send you $100 in Eth. My word is my bond.

So here goes. I know my public Eth address. I *thought* I had my private keyfile backed up. I now suspect I may have backed up the wrong keyfile. As in, the keyfile back up I have does not seem to match the public address I have been using. I am hoping I am wrong about this. I don't know how this could have happened. 

So question #1: Given a public address, and a private key file, how can I see if the public address belongs to the private key? 

I used my backup, copied the files to %appdata%/ethereum, and everything looks good. The UTC--whatever keystore file is present. When I load Mist wallet, the public address I see is not the right public address. Do I just need to like... tell it about the public address or something? Or is it 1:1 and if the public address it loaded is wrong, my keyfile is wrong?

Please help. I will deliver on the reward even if it's as simple as some command to add the account back.

Please try this new telegram bot I built for the ProductHunt hackathon: https://telegram.me/cryptovigil_bot?start=reddit.

CryptoVigil tracks all your ICO (or any ERC20) tokens in one place using just your Ethereum address in real time. You either copy paste the wallet address or send a picture of its QR code and CryptoVigil takes it from there. Unlike other portfolio apps or websites, it automatically pulls all your tokens, every token transfer made, whether through ICO, exchanges or even Airdops. You also never need to part with your private key, which means even hardware or paper wallets work just fine!

CryptoVigil runs its own Ethereum nodes ⛓to track token transfers in real time and hence alerts you via the bot each time you receive (or send) a token. Here's a quick GIF of it in action:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7ggsfu/if_and_that_is_an_if_we_are_entering_a_correction/dqjbuju/ 

And many of you suggested making this it's own thread, and I will repost it below. I know there is a lot of information out there about Ethereum, but a lot of it is honestly not designed or written to be read by people who are not programmers or computer scientists. Since Ethereum is under active development, and is only just getting started, I've found material that explains things at a higher level is lacking or just plain completely missing. Below is my explanation that I hope can help you investors in this technology understand exactly what it is you're investing in. Ethereum **is not** Bitcoin - *far* from it. I hope this will clear things up, especially for those investors that just blindly buy token sales for products or solutions that are actually not even possible or would make no sense to use Ethereum for. Unfortunately it seems like 8/10 token sales at the moment fall under this (you know... meme-tier bootstrap.js website)

#As high level and as layman like as I can make it: 

When you buy Ethereum, you are buying ""work units"" in a **massive** super computer and cloud network spanning the entire globe. ETH, although it can be exchanged for currency or used as currency, is actually used to incentivize nodes on the Etherum network to process information and data for you. This is called gas, paid in fractions of an ETH 'coin' (like 0.00000010 ETH). This is unlike with bitcoin, which is intended to be used purely for financial transactions. Ethereum can do that too, but it can also say, run javascript-like code on a webpage - or host static content like image files. Now instead of paying Amazon or Google Cloud Services hundreds of dollars per month in hosting a virtual machine (basically a server within a server), you can host entire websites for PENNIES per month, or even a one time cost of just a few cents! Storing or changing the data costs money, but it's a one time cost. Retrieving the data is free. This is where smart contracts come in. If you need to store ""memory"" on the blockchain, contracts do that. It only costs money to write in or change that data - or to *do something* with that data. Not to retrieve it. So say if you host an image on the Ethereum blockchain through the SWARM protocol, users can retrieve that data by pointing to it's hash. Really the website administrator would do this, and you'd have no idea. You'd load images from the Ethereum network in your browser without realizing it. It looks/acts/behaves like a normal website, but underneath is a series of extremely complicated mathematics (aptly called mathemagic) that make the most widely used encryption today look like crayon drawings.   

Now say if your code used memory, like having a number field in the web page and then displaying double that number, you would have to send data to that **smart contract** and it would *store the data in memory*, then *do work with it* and finally *output the result*. The parts that cost gas are the storing and doing. Now say if the user wants to recall the calculation they made a minute ago, or submits the exact same number as before. They can do this without needing to resubmit to the contract, all history is stored within the blockchain. That previous transaction will be recorded there forever. So as more things are done on the blockchain, the more efficient computing becomes. You only have to calculate or *do the thing* **once**. And *never have to waste precious CPU time again*. You can simply recall that previous transaction. Never before with computing has something like this even been possible, and for us tech guys the concept is just mind blowing. It has so many applications and will completely disrupt and overthrow big cloud providers today. We're talking slashing IT operating costs by 90%. In the applications I have developed for it, I was able to make websites that would normally cost $120 a month to host down to just a single one time cost of $0.12 to host static content and $7 a month for the rest. It's like watching the rise of the internet all over again for those 'in the know'. 

Next time you buy Ethereum, or sell it - remember what you're *actually* trading. Bitcoin ain't got nothing on what Ethereum is about to become. And all those people who are just buying it for investment just don't know what the hell they're sitting on top of. If bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital black-gold. And you just accumulated it before the next industrial revolution.   

I hope I was able to keep it within the realm someone non-technical can understand. If you have any other questions, I'll be happy to answer all you can throw at me.

However, much of this utility up until now has been speculative. There haven't been many apps we can point to which highlight Ethereum's real-world use case. [EtherDelta](http://etherdelta.com/) was a great first step, but its primary function is to speculate on the utility of the platform rather than to use Ethereum for some function external to itself. 

But we are now at the dawn of a new era of Ethereum's growth. The first wave of long-awaited applications recently launched or are about to come online. This marks the transition from speculative utility to genuine utility and will begin the realisation of Ethereum's vision.

explaining ethereum is more akin to bill gates and microsoft. ethereum is the operating system upon which applications can be built which gives additional value to ether as a currency (in the same way that adoption by computer builders made bill gates rich) as a whole as so many people use it. apps on ethereum have to interact with the blockchain and that happens by way of transactions. if you own ether, which all these apps need to pay for transactions then the value will increase as more and more people need ether to do stuff. ether is basically akin to a share of the operating systems fuel that it needs to run on. they tend to get it after that.",None,rakeruk,t3_7gwvoe

It is simply too much and doesn't make blockchain better. 90% of whitepapers I read today could accomplish the exact same thing with Ether or USDT. Now, there are absolutely certain projects that require its own token but like I mentioned 90% absolutely do not.


Tokens are hindering the adoption of Ethereum as a platform, can you imagine having to pay for everything in some different kind of coin? I fear we end up in a society like this.

You wake up and you go to eat breakfast but realize that your out of milk so you go to the store. At the store you go to pay and find out they only accept **BreadCoin** their own currency, but thats fine you open your smart phone and go to your cryptobank account to buy some **BreadCoin**. Only issue is your cryptobank stores all your money in **BankCoin** and doesnt offer **BreadCoin** so you need to buy **ExchangeCoin** to turn your **BankCoins** into **BreadCoins**. 


Everything works fine and youre on your way home but run out of gas so you stop at the gas station and pay using **GasCoin**. Then your landlord says you owe rent so you go to transfer money but you don't have **RentCoin**. You then spend 10 minutes transferring all your other coins into **RentCoin** and send it through their ""express lane network"" that requires an **ExpressToken** to send money faster.


You shrug it off and get into your car and turn on the music to wind down, then you find out your streaming music service ran out of **MusicCoins** so you need to buy more music coin to continue your subscription.


Now before you go on about straw-man argument or snowballing, you have to see my point. Having a dozen different tokens and currency each with volatile prices is not conductive to a health block chain environment.

Once the blockchain is synced, there is a button Develop-&gt;start mining that he lectured presses to start mining. However, on my mist, the only button says “sync with lite client”.


So, unable to begin mining there, I downloaded Parity and ethminer and tried to connect the two. But the parity Mac installer doesn’t install the command line tools, so I can’t do any mining.

I would be really appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction!


EDIT: OK!!! So I finally got everything working. What i did was delete parity and mist from my applications, and re-installed parity with brew. I also installed geth with brew. 

Then, to synchronize parity with the Ropsten chain, I ran parity --chain ropsten --no-warp. I ran it with no-warp because I would like to make it a practice to be as secure as possible when using crypto currencies and not get lazy. To load the GUI, you run 'parity ui'.

As for mining, I installed Minergate. I am not going to begin mining until proof of stake is implemented in the next fork.

My biggest confusion in this whole situation was that blockchain technologies(unsurprisingly) are not simple, and even the commonly accepted GUIs need a good deal of understanding. But right now I feel like I did when I was just learning about how to use linux - a lack of knowledge about the subject, ironically, prevents you from understanding the technical jargon that is used to learn that knowledge.

1. Create viruses that are undetactable for months that sit there collecting information.
2. Get root CAs which allow impersonation of SSL websites and OS drivers.
3. Use multiple Zero Day hacks to create viruses that spread like wildfire and don't require a user to do anything wrong.
4. Infiltrate market leading companies and modify hardware provided to customers.
5. Jump air gaps in many ways
6. Infiltrate a highly secure airgapped nuclear facility and destroy centrifuges without nuclear scienticts figuring out what was happening.

My questions:

1. Do we really think our Nano Ledgers will stand up against a state sponsored attack?
2. Are our air gapped stashes really as secure as we think? Can we trust that our hardware wasn't tampered with?
3. How will the average Joe be able to be their own bank and securely interact with blockchains that hold their degrees, IDs, etc.
4. Will Vitalik and Vlad's bleeding edge crypto efforts withstand state sponsored sabotage over a period of years?

The future of the blockchain is about much more than our crypto holdings.

2. Aid distribution
3. Banking
4. IDs

He brought forward the concept of a Ethereum Claim Registry. The idea is you are able to create a contract which can make claims about others. You have 4 values: 


* The issuer (who adds the claim into the regsitry)


* The subject (who the claim is regarding)


* The key (what the claim is e.g. ""credit score"", ""points"", or ""status"")


* The value the bytes 32 value for the key


At first this doesn't seem like much, however, this can be used to create a massive blacklist of addresses to prevent exchanges from buying crypto from hackers or others who used illicit means to acquire these. Governments can simply create this list and create regulations requiring all cash to crypto transactions to require a registry check.


Obviously before ERC#780 nothing stopped governments from imposing such limitations but it definitely opens the door a little bit more.


Obviously there are many more uses for a registry like this but this made me think and I want to know if you think this is a possibility? ",None,Bearist,t3_7gp1xm

As you can [read from the contract] (https://etherscan.io/address/0x851b7f3ab81bd8df354f0d7640efcd7288553419#readContract), the owners of the wallet contract are 0x9f7dfab2222a473284205cddf08a677726d786a0, 0x5210c4dcd7eb899a1274fd6471adec9896ae05aa,

And the number of required signatures is 3.

I don't understand how these are the owners of the contract if this is not hardcoded in the contract... I don't know where the required number of signatures is specified neither... I want to deploy this contract myself and change the addresses and the number of required signatures. 

I have deployed an ERC20 token before and I hardcoded the parameters in the .sol file and deployed it in https://remix.ethereum.org/ but I don't know how to pass constructor arguments if they are not hardcoded.

### What is MEW?

https://i.imgur.com/rrkqpOw.png

*   MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface.
*   We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys &amp; your funds.
*   You and only you are responsible for your security.
*   We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your private key.

---

### MyEtherWallet is not a Bank

https://i.imgur.com/zYsKqTe

*   When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system.
*   The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.
*   The bank charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen.
*   The bank allows you to write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.
*   You have an account with the bank or exchange and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee.

---

### MyEtherWallet is an Interface

https://i.imgur.com/7QNSG0B.png

*   When you create an account on MyEtherWallet you are generating a cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).
*   The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.
*   We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.
*   We do not charge a transaction fee.
*   You are simply using our interface to interact directly with the blockchain.
*   If you send your public key (address) to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens. 👍
*   If you send your private key to someone, they now have full control of your account. 👎

---

### Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?

https://i.imgur.com/Wjs2hv3.png

*   The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet.
*   It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is.
*   It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers.
*   The blocks in the blockchain are made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, Mist, Geth, Parity, and everywhere else.
*   When you see your balance on MyEtherWallet.com or view your transactions on etherscan.io, you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems.
*   Again: we are not a bank

---

### We need you to understand that we **cannot**...

https://i.imgur.com/mY8gqoF.png

*   Access your account or send your funds for you X.
*   Recover or change your private key.
*   Recover or reset your password.
*   Reverse, cancel, or refund transactions.
*   Freeze accounts.

### **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security.

*   Be diligent to keep your private key and password safe. Your private key is sometimes called your mnemonic phrase, keystore file, UTC file, JSON file, wallet file.
*   If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it.
*   If you enter your private key on a phishing website, you will have all your funds taken.

---

### If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point?

https://i.imgur.com/FG9cYhd.png

*   Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain.
*   You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.
*   You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.
*   If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. 😉
*   If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames &amp; passwords.
*   If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)! These keep your keys secure.

### How To Protect Yourself from Phishers

https://i.imgur.com/zhEtRp7.png

Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

*   Use the [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html) Chrome Extension to block malicious websites.
*   Always check the URL: `https://www.myetherwallet.com`.
*   Always make sure the URL bar has `MYETHERWALLET LLC [US]` in green.
*   Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
*   Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email.
*   [Install an AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google).

### How To Protect Yourself from Scams

https://i.imgur.com/7L7wGTp.png

People will try to get you to give them money in return for nothing.

*   If it is too good to be true, it probably is.
*   Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary.
*   Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right.
*   Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself ""why?"". It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research.

---

### How To Protect Yourself from Loss

https://i.imgur.com/E2F0Dvx.png


If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it.

*   Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.
*   Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop.
*   Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.
*   If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.

Let us know what you think!** 🙌 💃🏿 

Aaron always ends his podcast with a ""challenge"" for listeners. My challenge (below) is for listeners, but also a something we at MyEtherWallet have been actively working on ourselves: 

&gt; Be more aware &amp; mindful of how you respond when people are asking for help or guidance, even if it doesn't seem like they are looking for help. Especially on reddit / social media, it is so easy to dismiss comments or questions as, 'that person is a troll' or 'that person is an asshole' or 'that person is stupid'.

&gt; Pause for a moment and be mindful of the experience that person is having. Even if they are yelling and screaming, try consider if it's due to lack of understanding, a really really bad day, or something else. How do you respond? Is there something you can do to prevent this in the future?

We at MyEtherWallet are doing our best to understand and help educate and support the *underlying* cause of their question, message, or really really really really angry email. (*e.g. our recent [""Getting Started with MyEtherWallet""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7ggc0c/getting_started_with_myetherwalletcom/) pop-over and posts!*)

For those who don't know, MyEtherWallet has grown from a team of 2 to a team of 17 in less than 5 months. Growing isn't easy, and making decisions &amp; dealing with hard questions with an international and ever-growing team is not something I would recommend doing for fun 😜. I am incredibly lucky to have found such amazing people to join #TeamMEW, but we are even luckier to have a supportive community around us.

We massively appreciate you for sticking with us, letting us know what you think of us (constructively is preferred 😉), and helping those around you become more well-versed and secure in this crypto-world. With another big price jump and influx of new users, everyone (including us) needs as much support as possible.

**Disclaimer:** I own zero IOTA. I want to discuss what's said before the author starts shilling IOTA.

This are the quotes that got me thinking. 
&gt; Financial rewards will always create inequality. By paying someone to run the network, you are giving away your power. By giving away your power, the system becomes unbalanced: there are few powerful players and the large, powerless base. The base cannot exist without the powerful miners, who get more and more powerful as the time progresses.

&gt; You might argue, that Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will solve everything, but it is just shifting the problem. In PoS whoever has the biggest pile of coins runs the show, so to speak. So you exchanged hashrate for wealth, which is just the same. It might be better for the environment, but doesn’t solve the problem of centralisation.

&gt; PoW, PoS or whatever. As long as it rewards the miners, it puts them above and beyond the system. The only motive for miners to keep everything running is money. 

&gt; Hence, when it comes to upgrades of the blockchain, they will always put their own selfish interests first. The users are not happy? Well, fork the chain and let’s see who has more (hashrate) power. 

So if any of this is wrong I'm interested in knowing why. If not, what are your thoughts about it?

Roughly there are two biggest issues:
1) founders dumping tokens post ICO
2) founders having access to all the ether raised immediately post-ICO

Issue 1) is commonly covered by so called ""token vesting"", locking founders' tokens for certain periods. Commonly certain percentage is released each six months.
However issue 2) is rarely addressed. While ICOs use voting mechanisms in the actual platform (i.e. [Aragon](https://aragon.one/)), for some reason seems [CryptoTask](https://www.cryptotask.org/) is the only ICO using voting to control the release of funds in stages post ICO. I am not aware if other mechanisms are used to address this issue.

It remains to be seen if the community will be able to structure the eco-system in a way to properly govern itself, or we will see governments stepping in more and more to regulate the market.

If I send a friend X ETH they can see exactly how much money I have. This isn't a concern for me personally because my friends who have ETH already know how much ETH I have, but I can see it presenting a security and privacy risk for day-to-day transactions (I'm sure businessmen would prefer their barista doesn't know how wealthy they are to the dime).

Now, I've heard that Ethereum will be implementing zk-snarks from Zcash as an anonymity/privacy feature, but this still seems suboptimal to me. A coin like Monero for example is fully anonymous, because anonymous transactions are the default. In a mixed public and anonymous transaction context, it seems you will never have total anonymity. This is because one past transaction that can be traced back to you will identify you. So for example if I use zk-snarks to send an anonymous transaction, but you can trace the totality of the rest of my blockchain history, you can calculate exactly how much I sent in that transaction. 

This public/private blockchain issue also raises the risk that your transaction will be suspected of being fraudulent if the standard is public transactions and you choose to make an anonymous transaction.

I moved towards blockchain as a technology progressively and in February 2016 started active solidity development of the ""decentralized hedge fund"", initially branded Drago, then re-branded RigoBlock as it is a blockchain project comprising a protocol for decentralized asset management and many reusable components.

RigoBlock aims at allowing anyone to create their own decentralized pool of tokens and manage investors in an orderly manner, with the lowest barriers to entry for emerging traders. External devs will also be able to create their own platform on top of our protocol. A special case of our pools will allow for proof-of-stake mining with Casper.

Today RigoBlock has a team of 3, plus two external contributors, has been accepted into H-Farm's blockchain business accelerator and is in the process of finalizing its first external investment (so far the project has been self-funded). We are still a small project and, notwithstanding market pressures, are looking to stay a small team and be totally focused on product.

We envision tokens as a new asset class and are looking to organize decentralized pools of tokens.

We took a big risk in building on top of Ethereum, as at the beginning most bitcoiners were critical about it. Luckily for us, the decision is paying off now, as we no longer have to defend our choice of building on top of Ethereum as a base layer.

&gt;Key to SPECTRE’s achievements is the fact that it satisfies weaker properties than classic consensus requires. 


&gt;In the conventional paradigm, the order between any two transactions must be decided and agreed upon by all non-corrupt nodes.



&gt;In contrast, SPECTRE only satisfies this with respect to transactions performed by honest users. We observe that in the context of money, two conflicting payments that are published concurrently could only have been created by a dishonest user, hence we can afford to delay the acceptance of such transactions without harming the usability of the system.

I recently heard the following argument. Proof of Work is what makes crypto special because it requires hard work (mining == electricity) to print new coins. Over time people (hardware) will get better at mining which guarantees that it will always be difficult to print new coins. This is great for cryptocurrencies because unlike fiat, they will always be deflationary.

With Proof of Stake on the other hand, once you gather enough capital, you can stop innovating and 'live off interest' which means that there won't be any intrinsic value in the newly printed coins. Whereas with Proof of Work it is precisely the electricity burned that constitutes the intrinsic value.

Let's say Zillow figures out a way to automate a lot of the real estate market.  Find the house, put the down payment in escrow, inspection, all that is handled via smart contracts.  Including the deed that sits out there until payment is made in full.  Let's say a hacker finds out how to do something bad with this.  Do we fork?  If so, what about all the other thousands of companies that are on the chain by this time (fingers crossed)?


How will we handle all of this at scale?

Is it fair to expect these companies to ""deal with it, we're immutable!""?  I don't think that's the right approach if we're expecting this to be a global platform.


I am of the opinion that I believe in the tech and the team.  They are building something amazing.  I honestly feel if we want this thing to be a global platform we need to be okay with forking as needed to combat malicious behavior.  If that is the case...how do we handle this at scale?

People are understandably negative toward contentious forks, but non-contentious forks are the mechanism for upgrading the software. Because of costs, miners can only really mine one chain, and will follow the most profitable chain eventually. This means buyers determine the state of the fork via mass adoption and valuation in proof-of-work systems, right? Trying to wrap my head around proof-of-stake. Because staking will require so much less computing power, in the case of a fork, stakers could conceivably run both chains. What incentive is there for them not to? I don't want to see the ETH ecosystem devolve into the sort of misinformation campaigns like those in the extended bitcoin universe. Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond. BitcoinCash4Gold(/jk) etc. Ugh. Those happen even though mining is costly and should disincentivize such behavior. So what about PoS and staking? Could this turn every fork into a contentious fork? What am I missing that inhibits such behavior?

I'm thrilled about a technology that can transition cryptocurrency away from the insane amount of electricity wasted using Proof-of-Work mining. Bitcoin mining along uses more electricity than ~150 individual countries! I just want to make sure I understand the alternatives.

Are the ETH rewards stakers receive going to come from transaction fees, newly created ETH, or both?

I'm just curious and trying to wrap my head around how it will work. With mining, you're essentially competing with other miners for the reward (set per block), so if there are more miners, this decreases the chances of you getting the reward. Is it the same with with Staking? How about inflation/deflation? If most to all of the reward comes from newly created ETH, you've got an overall inflation rate dependent on how rewarding you make staking. If most to all of the reward for staking comes from transaction fees or 'gas', ETH could even become deflationary as ETH is accidentally lost over time by users in wallets that can no longer be accessed.

Who decides those rates? Vitalik Buterin and other developers, or is there going to be some sort of internal government system with ETH holders, users, stakers, devs, dapp devs, getting some sort of vote?",None,molecularbioguy,t3_7g5te6

Those who’ve been around for a while know that Ethereum is much more than him. The EF is staffed with great developers, and VB doesn’t actually do any production development. He works on research, mainly re hybrid Casper and scalability. Also Ethereum ecosystem is very rich and expanding everyday, with individuals, new projects &amp; companies.

Yet, there is an ideological &amp; agenda-setting dependency on Vitalik, and public perception focuses extremely on his person, increased by the fact that he’s really active with many projects, lots of traveling and projects (a good thing overall!). If for whatever reason Vitalik would suddenly stop or reduce his involvement in Ethereum, I think it’s safe to expect a temporary stalling in progress (due to confusion and lack of direction) and a sharp fall in value of the network - in market terms (ETH price), effective use and public perception.

This is for me the single point of failure of Ethereum. Decentralization means that points of failure are reduced by reducing centers of authority/influence and its distribution through the network + reduction of barriers to access. BTC solved this problem long time ago: disappearance of Satoshi. We cannot and we don’t desire the same for Vitalik, therefore we’d need actions to reduce his influence and for redistribution of his power, without affecting the extremely high value he provides to Ethereum.

In the past months I've been spending a lot of my time thinking how Ethereum could reach mass adoption and have products in real world interact with Ethereum and one problem came almost every time: price stability

Every one of us wants mainstream adoption, everyone of us I bet wants to  get rid of banks and to shift the transaction processing from giants like Visa or MasterCard into the hands of miners or validators, to be able to pay directly for goods or services using Ether or Ethereum-based tokens but that is far from happening without a stable and decentralized cryptocurrency.

 Most merchants wouldn't accept a currency that has the chance to loose 50% of its value in a week and they would want to buy new goods to sell around that time. and most holders wouldn't want to use Ether to buy goods when its price is not that good. Converting crypto into fiat is very expensive with very high fees...Crypto cards like Monaco or TenX convert crypto to fiat in order to pay merchants but while it's convenient it's not efficient and involves exchanging crypto and a second layer of validation handled by Visa or MasterCard which is not good, at their end they charge around 3% per transaction which is money lost by the customer/merchant. 

I strongly believe we can get rid of third parties, excessive fees and fiat by using Ethereum. We need is to create a system that will replace the old. While fiat won't be replaced anytime soon I believe this concept will speed up this process and provide a lot of advantages. 

Let's analyze Tether, each token is supposed to represent 1$ stored in their bank accounts. The fundamental problem is that it is highly centralized with a single point of failure. If the regulators decide to shut down their bank accounts the token would be worthless. Another problem is that apart from some numbers on their page I see no transparency, we can't be sure the numbers in their bank accounts match the ones on their website. Some say it's a ticking time bomb.

A decentralized stable cryptocurrency wouldn't have this problem, All the Ether backing each token would be public and everyone could check it and no matter what the governments or regulators decide the system could still continue to work 

The basic idea is to create a decentralized autonomous organization that would issue a stable token(initially pegged to USD) when Ether is sent to a smart contract, when people want to convert the stable currency into Ether they would simply send it to the contract and it will be automatically converted based on the Ether price in fiat and that will happen in a matter of seconds.

To stabilize the price we have to borrow some concepts from Delegating Proof of Stake. There will be a governance token for our DAO which allows the holders to vote for entities which will have the ability to input the price or Ether(or other tokens later on) and stabilize the price of the stable cryptocurrency and reach a consensus for the price by combining the inputs and penalizing and ignoring the ones who are not within some limits(for example the real price is 500$ on average and someone inputs 600$ or 300$).  The holders of the governance token could vote for changing the amount of Ether for backing each stable token in order to make it stable, for example having 1.5 or 2$ worth of Ether for each 1$ worth of stable currency and what's above that limit to be distributed to token holders and the ones chosen to stabilize the price. The price of Ether will naturally appreciate over time and from there the profits will come. There could be some fees when there is not enough Ether to stabilize it.

For the situation where there is not enough Ether to stabilize the token there will be around 30% of the governance tokens kept which will be distributed to the stable token holders just like Neo/Gas which will make the stable coin a much more desirable token to hold than Ether even when during the times where it is not stable(like in the beginning). 

This token has much more potential than simply being a stable token to trade. I envision an entire developer ecosystem around it. Being able to pay smart contracts with this stable token, protecting merchants and the regular holders from volatility and many many more.

The whole point is to transform value from an unstable state into a stable one and the other way. Through smart contracts this could be achieved without any fraud and complete transparency

I really want to make this system a reality but I want to see how the community perceives it, if it would really bring value and there will be people who will use it. I would appreciate any feedback(especially the negative one so I could improve the model).

Once the dedicated blockchain is ready, it is designed so that it listens to a token burning contract on the Ethereum network. All the ERC20 token holders are able to send the funds to the burning contract while specifying their address on the dedicated blockchain as a parameter. That way all the balances can be migrated from Ethereum to the dedicated blockchain.

I cannot give away my idea, but I need developers who are interested in impacting the world to help me with a non-profit ICO.  Here is what I feel I can share:

1.  The total coin supply will be limited to the approximate population of the earth.  Since many people don't have internet access it will be understood that there will be many unclaimed coins.  Since we cannot know the exact population of the earth the coin supply will at no point in time exceed the estimated population of the earth.
2.  No being will be allowed more than 1 coin or less than one coin; there are no fractions of a coin.  Adding new coins does not dilute the value of the coin because coins cannot be resold or transferred and therefore have no value since one of the underlying necessities to value is transferrability.  This will probably be among the most burdensome of concepts to the developer, however, there is no motivation whatsoever for a coin holder to hoard valueless coins that can't be transferred.
3.  The total cost of the coin is exactly what someone is willing to pay for it.  The amount they are willing to pay is based on both the value they put on what the coin represents as well as what they can afford.  If they can only afford 1 cent, so be it, that will buy their coin.  Bill Gates may contribute 1 billion, some homeless person may spend 1 cent.  Most people won't even be interested.
4.  The project is intended to be humanitarian.
5.  It can change the world.
6.  It can be huge.
7.  You will feel good about yourself if we try and fail, but we won't.

Please message me for additional information.  I can pay you but the right person probably won't require pay.  If Ethereum is BitCoin 2.0  then this coin is Altruism 2.0.

1) Boot a fresh linux install on an air-gapped machine

2) Install geth from a USB stick and run 'geth account new'

3) Input a random 12-word password 

4) Copy keystore and password to several secure locations

5) Wipe machine

6) Send eth to address and verify using etherscan.io

To test recovery I transferred a small amount of eth and then accessed it using MEW and my keystore and everything seemed to work fine.

I purchased a bit of Ethereum a while ago, so I have an adress and a password, with the ammount of Ethereum ""in it"" (is that the right phrasing?) 
I can view my balance  on *myetherwallet.com* but I hear that it's safer to download a wallet program, the way I downloaded Electrum for my Bitcoins. So now I downloaded and installed Mist, but I don't really understand what I am doing yet. 
So (**question 1**) How do I get my Ethereum ""transferred"" to mist?  When I am in Mist I see a ""main account"" and I see the option to add new accounts. But can I import my existing Ethereum adress + password (and the ammount of Eth that is already behind that) or isn't that how it works? Or should I transfer my Ethereum that is currently in my existing adress, to a new adress in Mist?

Also (**question 2**):
What's with the ""syncing"" (?) of like 4 million records whenever I launch Mist? What is it doing and is this going to take so long everytime I launch it? I have never noticed something like that when I launch Electrum for instance (for my Bitcoins), but maybe there is an explanation or a difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum that I am completely missing.

Come to think of it, I have two more questions:

**3.**
What is the difference between EthereumWallet and Mist? Which is better for me? I just want to be able to simply buy, store, and sell Ethereum. But the two names seem to be used confusingly, and for some reason both have the same download page. I am confused. I downloade Mist because I heard that's the one that was recommended to me, but now I am not sure.

**4.**
So my next question is, once I have my Ethereum in Mist, how do I sell it when I want to? Because I can't find a buy/sell option in Mist, or isn't that how it works?

Thanks in advance and sorry if these are newbie questions, or the wrong place to ask them.",None,hsepiavista,t3_7fq7eu
